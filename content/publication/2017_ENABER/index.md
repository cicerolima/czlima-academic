abstract: The purpose of this article is to evaluate the impacts of reduced transport costs for the soy sector in the Brazilian regions. We use the model of General Equilibrium Analysis Project of the Brazilian Economy (PAEG). To achieve the goal, it simulated an improvement in the transport system in the Brazilian regions of the soy sector, and the impact on the main shopping blocks. The results were consistent with the literature, showing that a reduction in transportation cost increases productivity and favor Brazilian exports.
